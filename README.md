This is a game under development using the Godot Game Engine, it is also a team project working in a club at the San Jose State University, known as the SJSU Game Dev Club.

So If you like to give it a test run to try and or analyze what needs to be fixed, by all means go ahead! Just use the Download to ZIP to get the files, use the Godot Engine to mess around with it.
